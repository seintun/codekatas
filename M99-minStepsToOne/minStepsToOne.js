/**
Minimum steps to minimize n as per given condition
Given a number n, count minimum steps to minimize it to 1 according to the following criteria:

If n is divisible by 2 then you may reduce n to n/2.
If n is divisible by 3 then you may reduce n to n/3.
Decrement n by 1.

Examples:
Input : n = 10
Output : 3

Input : 6
Output : 2

Test runtime for large n by unlocking test suites (6-10) // Total 2.5s
 */

function minStepsToOne(n) {
  // Write your code here.
}

module.exports = minStepsToOne;
