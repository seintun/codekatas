// Nth Fibonacci
// The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

// Sample input: 6
// Sample output: 5 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)

function getNthFib(n) {
  // Write your code here.
}

// Do not edit the line below.
